\item 
\begin{enumerate}
   \item $150$ spherical marbles, each of diameter $1\cdot4 cm$ are dropped in a cylinder vessel of diameter $7cm$ containing some water, and are completely immersed in water.Find the rise in the level of water in the cylindrical vessel

\item John planned a birthday party for his younger sister with his friends. They decided to make some birthday caps by themselves and to buy a cake from a bakery shop. For these two items, they decided the following dimensions:
\\
Cake : Cylindrical shape with diameter $24 cm$ and height $14 cm.$

Cap : Conical shape with base circumference $44 cm$ and height $24 cm.$
\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}
Based on the above information, answer the following questions :
\begin{enumerate}
    \item How many square cm paper would be used to make 4 such caps ?
    \item The bakery shop sells cakes by weight $(0\cdot5 kg, 1 kg, 1\cdot5 kg, etc.).$ To have the required dimensions, how much cake should they order, if $650 cm^3$ equals $100 g$ of cake ?
\end{enumerate}

\item 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The curved surface area of a right circular cylinder is $176 sq cm$ and its volume is$1232 cu cm$ what is the height of the cylinder?

    \item The largest sphere is carved out of a solid cube of side $21cm$ Find the volume of sphere
\end{enumerate}
\item Khurja is a city in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh famous for the pottery.Khurja pottery is traditional Indian pottery work which has attracted Indians as well as foreighners with a variety of tea sets,crockery and ceramic tile works. A huge portion of the ceramics used in the country is supplied by Khurja and is also referred as 'The Ceramic Town'
One of the private schools of Bulandshahr organised an Educational Tour for class 10 students to Khurja. Students were very excited about the trip. Following are the few pottery objects of Khurja
\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}
Students found the shapes of the objects very interesting and they could easily relate them with mathematical shapes viz sphere, hemisphere, cylinder etc. Maths teacher who was accompanying the students asked following question:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The internal radius of hemispherical bowl(filled completely with water)in I is $9cm$ and radius and height of cylindrical jar in II is $1\cdot5cm$ and $4cm$ respectively. If the hemisherical bowl is to be emptied in cylindrical jars, then how many cylindrical jars are required?
    \item If in the cylindrical jar full of water, a conical funnel of same height and same diameter is immersed, then how much water will flow out of the jar?
\end{enumerate}
\newpage
\item How many spherical shots each having diameter $3 cm$ can be made by melting a cuboidal solid of dimensions $18 cm$ x $22 cm$ x $6 cm$ ?
\item Conical bottom tanks in which an inverted cone at the bottom is surmounted by a cylinder of same diameter, are very advantageous in industry, specially where getting every last drop from the tank is important.

Vikas designed a conical bottom tank where the height of the conical part is equal to its radius and the height of the cylindrical part is two times of its radius. The tank is closed from the top.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If the radius of the cylindrical part is $3 m$, then find the volume of the tank.
    \item Find the ratio of the volume of the cylindrical part to the volume of the conical part.
\end{enumerate}
